# LinLog-project
This is a project from the course Linear and Logistic Regression Analysis, given at Lund University Faculty of Engineering (LTH). 

Made together with my classmate Lovisa Bielke. The project is mainly manifested in an R-script, and is a linear model fitted to predict life expectancy in anonymized countries. Data is taken from Gapminder.
